## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: I think I deserve a 19/20 or a 20/20. This is because I completed everything the assignment asked for on time and covered all of the grading points. My game runs well and I tested it many times. The only reason I might deduct a point is because I cant seem to pass 1 of the 6 tests on the assignment checks(the one checking for nodes in my directory), but did pass 5/6 tests.

## Self-Reflection:

This assignment was the most challenging by far but I really enjoyed it! Getting to put together everything we have learned so far to create this game was very fun and aside from some issues with the json fetch I was able to use your provided resources to do everything smoothly.
### How long it took me to finish this?
about 5 hours.
